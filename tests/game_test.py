'''
Round 1

When defending against Orcs I want a way to tell when one has breached the perimeter so I can deploy defenses
When diagnosing alert system issues, I want a way to isolate output from particular modules at certain levels so I don't have to sift through as much logging data
When interfacing with the system I want "X" to quit the program so I can stop this charade.
When analyzing threats I want a way to see distance so I can tell how far away each one is.
When analyzing threats I want a way to see velocity so I can tell how quickly it's closing in.
